Title: Two Functions for Generalized SARIMA Time Series Simulation
Author: Olivier Briet <o.briet@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Olivier Briet <o.briet@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.4.0)
Imports: MASS
Description: Write SARIMA models in (finite) AR representation and simulate 
	generalized multiplicative seasonal autoregressive moving average (time) series 
	with Normal / Gaussian, Poisson or negative binomial distribution. 
	The methodology of this method is described in Briet OJT, Amerasinghe PH, and 
	Vounatsou P (2013) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0065761>.
